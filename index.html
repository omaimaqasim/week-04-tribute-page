          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Allama Muhammad Iqbal was born on 9th November 1877 in Sialkot, Punjab (British India),
            into a Kashmiri family. His father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad, was a devout Muslim of humble means,
            and his mother, Imam Bibi, was a kind-hearted woman deeply respected for her piety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iqbal received his early education in Sialkot, where he studied Arabic and Persian.
            Later, he joined Government College Lahore, where he was influenced by Sir Thomas Arnold,
            a professor of philosophy, who greatly shaped his intellectual development.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            After Lahore, Iqbal went to Europe for higher studies.
            He studied at the University of Cambridge and then earned a doctorate in philosophy
            from the University of Munich, Germany. His exposure to Western philosophy enriched
            his thought while strengthening his vision for Islamic revival.
          </p>
          <p>
            He also studied law at Lincoln’s Inn in London, which gave him insight into modern political systems.
            During his stay in Europe, he engaged with the works of Western thinkers such as Nietzsche and Goethe.
            These experiences helped him develop a unique synthesis of Eastern spirituality and Western philosophy.

          <h2>Poetry and Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            Iqbal’s poetry, written in Urdu and Persian, inspired Muslims to rediscover their identity.
            Works such as <i>Bang-e-Dra</i>, <i>Asrar-e-Khudi</i>, and <i>Payam-e-Mashriq</i>
            reflect his ideas on selfhood, faith, and the awakening of nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            His concept of <b>“Khudi”</b> (selfhood) encouraged individuals to realize their inner potential.
            He believed that true freedom came from spiritual awakening and self-respect.
            Through his verses, he connected classical Islamic values with the challenges of modern times.

          <h2>Political Role</h2>
          <p>
            In his famous Allahabad Address of 1930, Iqbal envisioned a separate homeland
            for Muslims of India. His political philosophy guided the Pakistan Movement,
            earning him the title <b>“Mufakkir-e-Pakistan”</b> (Thinker of Pakistan).
          </p>
          <p>
            He was a member of the All India Muslim League and actively participated in political debates.
            His speeches and writings laid the intellectual foundation for Muslim unity in South Asia.
            Many leaders, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, were influenced by his vision for a new nation.
