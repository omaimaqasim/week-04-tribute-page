                        Allama Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938), born in Sialkot, was a poet, philosopher, and visionary
                        whose ideas inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is remembered as <b>Shair-e-Mashriq (Poet of the
                            East)</b>
                        and <b>Mufakkir-e-Pakistan (Thinker of Pakistan)</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Educated in Lahore, Cambridge, and Germany, Iqbal’s Urdu and Persian poetry awakened Muslims of
                        the subcontinent to their identity. His Allahabad Address of 1930 laid the foundation for a
                        separate homeland, and his works like <i>Bang-e-Dra</i> and <i>Asrar-e-Khudi</i> remain timeless
                        sources of inspiration.
