          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Allama Muhammad Iqbal was born on 9th November 1877 in Sialkot, Punjab (British India), 
            into a Kashmiri family. His father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad, was a devout Muslim of humble means, 
            and his mother, Imam Bibi, was a kind-hearted woman deeply respected for her piety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iqbal received his early education in Sialkot, where he studied Arabic and Persian. 
            Later, he joined Government College Lahore, where he was influenced by Sir Thomas Arnold, 
            a professor of philosophy, who greatly shaped his intellectual development.

            After Lahore, Iqbal went to Europe for higher studies. 
            He studied at the University of Cambridge and then earned a doctorate in philosophy 
            from the University of Munich, Germany. His exposure to Western philosophy enriched
